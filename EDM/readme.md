# Python Tools: EDM (Engineering Modelling and Designs)

Welcome to the **EDM (Engineering Modelling and Designs)** section of the `python tools` repository! This sub-folder is dedicated to showcasing Python’s powerful capabilities in engineering modelling, design automation, simulation, and analysis. EDM leverages Python’s extensive ecosystem—numerical, scientific, and visualization libraries—to streamline engineering workflows for students, academics, and professionals.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The EDM folder is built for:
- College assignments and self-driven learning in engineering design.
- Hands-on projects and code demonstrations for modelling physical systems.
- Automation of complex calculations, data analysis, and simulation tasks.
- Bridging theory with practice using Python’s computational strengths.
