# Python Tools: EDM (Engineering Modelling and Designs)

Welcome to the **EDM (Engineering Modelling and Designs)** section of the `python tools` repository! This sub-folder is dedicated to showcasing Python’s powerful capabilities in engineering modelling, design automation, simulation, and analysis. EDM leverages Python’s extensive ecosystem—numerical, scientific, and visualization libraries—to streamline engineering workflows for students, academics, and professionals.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The EDM folder is built for:
- College assignments and self-driven learning in engineering design.
- Hands-on projects and code demonstrations for modelling physical systems.
- Automation of complex calculations, data analysis, and simulation tasks.
- Bridging theory with practice using Python’s computational strengths.

## What You'll Find

- **Design Automation Scripts:** Python scripts for automating CAD (Computer-Aided Design) model generation, updating geometries, and repetitive design tasks using libraries such as `pythonOCC`, `FreeCAD`, and `ezdxf`[web:19].
- **Simulation and Analysis:** Notebooks and scripts utilizing powerful libraries such as `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `FEniCS`, and `SfePy` for finite element analysis (FEA), thermodynamic processes, fluid simulations, and structural calculations[web:16][web:17][web:19][web:20][web:22].
- **Visualization Tools:** Use of `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, and `Seaborn` for plotting engineering data, analytics, stress/strain diagrams, heat maps, and optimization surfaces[web:16][web:20][web:22][web:23].
- **Optimization Models:** Python files using `SciPy.optimize` and `Pyomo` for parameter and design optimization—ideal for academic and practical engineering scenarios[web:17][web:19][web:22].
- **Data Analysis Utilities:** Scripts for processing, validating, and visualizing experimental or simulation results using `Pandas` and `NumPy`—from CSV sensor data to statistical summaries[web:19][web:20][web:22].
