# Runge-Kutta Method: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The Runge-Kutta methods are a group of powerful algorithms for numerically solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), essential when exact solutions are unavailable or too complex to compute. The most widely-used member is the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method â€” celebrated for its balance of accuracy and computational efficiency[web:1].

## History and Significance

- Developed circa 1900 by Carl Runge and Martin Kutta.
- Provided a systematic approach for approximating solutions to complex ODEs before computers existed.
- RK methods are fundamental in simulations across science, engineering, biology, and finance due to their reliability and accuracy[web:1].
