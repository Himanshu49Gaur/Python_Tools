# Runge-Kutta Method: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The Runge-Kutta methods are a group of powerful algorithms for numerically solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), essential when exact solutions are unavailable or too complex to compute. The most widely-used member is the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method â€” celebrated for its balance of accuracy and computational efficiency[web:1].
