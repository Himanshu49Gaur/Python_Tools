# Euler and Modified Euler Methods for Solving ODEs

## Introduction
In mathematics and computational science, many real-world phenomena are described by **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** â€” equations involving rates of change. While some simple ODEs can be solved analytically to find an exact formula, many are too complex. **Numerical methods** provide a powerful way to find approximate solutions to these ODEs by breaking the problem down into small, discrete steps.

This document provides a detailed explanation of two fundamental numerical methods: the **Euler Method** and the **Modified Euler Method**.
